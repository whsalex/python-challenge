Image Sequences

The Python Imaging Library contains some basic support for image sequences (also called animation formats). Supported sequence formats include FLI/FLC, GIF, and a few experimental formats. TIFF files can also contain more than one frame.
When you open a sequence file, PIL automatically loads the *first frame* in the sequence. You can use the seek and tell methods to move between different frames:
##Eg. Reading sequences##

import Image

im = Image.open("animation.gif")
im.seek(1) # skip to the second frame

try:
    while 1:
        im.seek(im.tell()+1)
        # do something to im
except EOFError:
    pass # end of sequence

*As seen in this example, you'll get an EOFError exception when the sequence ends.*

Note that most drivers in the current version of the library *only allow you to seek to the next frame* (as in the above example). To rewind the file, you may have to reopen it.

##The following iterator class lets you to use the for-statement to loop over the sequence:##
A sequence iterator class

class ImageSequence:
    def __init__(self, im):
        self.im = im
    def __getitem__(self, ix):
        try:
            if ix:
                self.im.seek(ix)
            return self.im
        except EOFError:
            raise IndexError # end of sequence

for frame in ImageSequence(im):
    # ...do something to frame...
